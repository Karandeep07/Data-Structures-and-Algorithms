# We are given two arrays. We have to find if these two arrays contain any matching elements.
# For example, array1 = ['a','b','c','x'] , array2 = ['x','y','z']
# This should return True as element 'x' appears in both arrays.
# Example 2: array1 = ['a','b','c'] , array2 = ['x','y'] => False

# 2 inputs = 2 arrays - no size limit
# o/p: T or F

# Brute force approach
# loop through array1 and loop through array2 comparing each element of a2 with a1
# O(n^2)
# But array size can be different so Time complexity will be
# O(a*b)
