Data Structures and Algorithms in Python 

Data Structure: Ways to store data

Algorithm: Ways to use Data Structure (Instructions)

Data Structure + Algorithm = Programs

## What is a good code?

- Readable
- Scalable

Scalable: Theres often a tradeoff between speed and memory.
1. Speed (Time Complexity) 
2. Memory (Space Complexity)
